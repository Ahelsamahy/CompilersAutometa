# Description

The app transfers an input of numbers only, to a one-digit variable expression, then read a CSV file that contains rules that help in reaching an end of stack that starts with symbol `E` and print the rule number, all of this in same line.

In short version, it is a basic compilers that checks if the sentence you input can have a proper output based on the rules you provide.

# Functionalities 
The app does the basic requirement but i added extra steps such as:
* Check if the Converted text variable exists in the column header of the CSV file
* Check if the stack starting variable exists in the row header of the CSV file
* You can Edit the cells and export the file.
